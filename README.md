# DerpGPT

**A gloriously dumb AI chatbot that tries its best (but often fails).**

## 🤖 What is DerpGPT?
DerpGPT is a conversational AI model that generates responses based on synthetic persona-chat datasets. It was trained on multi-turn dialogues but often struggles to keep things coherent. Whether it's making up bizarre responses, misunderstanding context, or just plain derping out, DerpGPT is here to entertain.

## 🔥 Features
- **Word-Level Tokenization** – Because subword tokenization would be too smart.
- **Multi-Turn Dialogue Training** – Trained on synthetic conversations, yet somehow still confused.
- **Transformer-Based Architecture** – A 50M parameter model doing its best.
- **Blissful Cluelessness** – Expect unexpected answers.

## 🎯 How It Works
1. The user sends a message.
2. DerpGPT attempts to generate a relevant response.
3. It either succeeds, produces nonsense, or accidentally continues the conversation forever.

## 🛠️ Technical Overview
- Model: Custom Transformer (GPT-style, ~50M parameters)
- Training Data: Synthetic multi-turn persona-chat dialogues
- Hardware: Runs on CUDA / MPS (if available)
- Training Framework: PyTorch

## 🚀 Usage
```bash
python derpgpt.py
```
Then just start chatting with DerpGPT and embrace the chaos.

## 🧠 Known Issues
- Sometimes generates **entire conversations instead of single replies**
- Occasionally forgets it’s an AI and makes weird claims
- Might just keep talking forever if not stopped

## 🤡 Why DerpGPT?
Because not every AI needs to be smart. Sometimes, you just need an AI that derps its way through conversations for the sake of entertainment.

## 🎤 Try it out and let the derping begin!
